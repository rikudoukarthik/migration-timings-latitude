  abstract = {Under laboratory conditions, two mechanisms have been identified that control the onset of migration. One mechanism inflexibly controls the initiation of migration, while the other requires external input from a changing environment. It has been suggested that the evolution of these mechanisms has an ecological basis related to the wintering latitude of the species. To establish whether the timing of migration was consistent with this ecological explanation, we studied the long-term mean timing of spring migration, and within-year and among-year variance in timing, in 27 free-living Nearctic migrant species. Species that wintered in higher, temperate latitudes migrated significantly earlier than tropical-wintering species. Tropical-wintering species showed significantly less within-year and among-year variation in the timing of migration, suggesting that the mechanism regulating their migration is primarily endogenous, with little influence of external stimuli. In contrast, breeding latitude showed no relationship to the mean date of migration, or the within-year or among-year variation in timing. These results are consistent with the notion that conditions that indicate time-of-year are unreliable or change imperceptibly (photoperiod) in the tropics, making an endogenous circannual clock valuable for controlling the onset and progression of migration. Temperate-wintering species were more likely to show interspecific correlations in timing than tropical species, further suggesting that external cues modulate spring migration in temperate-wintering species. Our results indicate that the migration regulation system employed might be ultimately determined by wintering latitude and associated environmental cues.},

  abstract = {We attempt to quantify the relationship between migration and latitude in the avifauna of eastern North America. Progressing northward up the east side of the continent, the proportion of breeding species that moves south for the winter increases steadily, from 12\% at 25{$^\circ$}N (southern Florida) to 87\% at 80{$^\circ$}N (Ellesmere Island), a mean increase of 1.4\% for every degree of latitude. Conversely, the proportion of wintering species that moves north for the summer decreases with latitude, from 52\% at 25{$^\circ$}N to none at 70{$^\circ$}N, a mean decrease of 1.1\% for every degree of latitude. These relationships hold despite the fact that 24\% of all species breeding in eastern North America leave the area completely in fall to winter south of 25{$^\circ$}N, mostly in Central and South America (including the Caribbean Islands). These trends are similar to those in western Europe, but at any given latitude an average of 17\% more breeding species leave for the winter in eastern North America, and 10\% more wintering species leave for the summer. This difference is attributed to climate, in that at any given latitude temperatures are cooler in eastern North America than in Europe. We argue that relationships between migration and latitude exist because latitude is a good surrogate measure of factors likely to more directly influence migration, such as climate and daylength, which in turn control the amplitude of seasonal changes in food supplies.},

  abstract = {There is a conspicuous gradient in the proportion of passerine breeding communities contributed by tropical migrants (PPM) in Europe, with communities located in the northernmost areas showing the greatest percentages and those located to the south the smallest. I used multiple stepwise regression and regression on principal components to investigate the effects of a set of ecological, climatic, and geographical variables on migrant percentages in a sample of 55 European censuses distributed from northern Fennoscandia through southern Spain. When the main habitat types are considered individually, this geographic pattern is still significant. The best single predictor of PPM as revealed by multiple regression analyses is latitude, but when this variable is removed, the temperature of the coldest month provides almost equivalent predictions of PPM. Habitat type per se apparently does not influence substantially the percent of migrants in European breeding passerine communities. These results contrast with those reported by MacArthur (1959) for North America, although they are consistent with some suggestions derived from the recent reanalysis of North American data carried out by Willson (1976). Intercontinental differences are perhaps due to sampling deficiencies in the North American areas studied, mainly derived from the restricted latitudinal range. To explain the European pattern of PPM, I suggest that the percentage of migrants in a community during the breeding season depends on both the harshness of adverse winter conditions faced by the resident populations and on the total resource availability during the breeding period. Carrying capacity of the habitat during the severe season will to some extent regulate the size of resident populations in the following breeding period, which in turn must affect the abundance of migrants that may successfully colonize the habitat. Very harsh winters coupled to very productive breeding seasons favor the largest percentage of migrants.},

  abstract = {The life cycles of plants and animals are changing around the world in line with the predictions originated from hypotheses concerning the impact of global warming and climate change on biological systems. Commonly, the search for ecological mechanisms behind the observed changes in bird phenology has focused on the analysis of climatic patterns from the species breeding grounds. However, the ecology of bird migration suggests that the spring arrival of long-distance migrants (such as trans-Saharan birds) is more likely to be influenced by climate conditions in wintering areas given their direct impact on the onset of migration and its progression. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the first arrival dates (FADs) of six trans-Saharan migrants (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, swift Apus apus, hoopoe Upupa epops, swallow Hirundo rustica, house martin Delichon urbica and nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos), in a western Mediterranean area since from 1952 to 2003. By means of multiple regression analyses, FADs were analysed in relation to the monthly temperature and precipitation patterns of five African climatic regions south of the Sahara where species are thought to overwinter and from the European site from where FADs were collected. We obtained significant models for five species explaining 9--41\% of the variation in FADs. The interpretation of the models suggests that: (1) The climate in wintering quarters, especially the precipitation, has a stronger influence on FADs than that in the species' potential European breeding grounds. (2) The accumulative effects of climate patterns prior to migration onset may be of considerable importance since those climate variables that served to summarize climate patterns 12 months prior to the onset of migration were selected by final models. (3) Temperature and precipitation in African regions are likely to affect departure decision in the species studied through their indirect effects on food availability and the build-up of reserves for migration. Our results concerning the factors that affect the arrival times of trans-Saharan migrants indicate that the effects of climate change are more complex than previously suggested, and that these effects might have an interacting impact on species ecology, for example by reversing ecological pressures during species' life cycles.},

Here, we used over 7\,million community-contributed bird observations to derive species-specific, spatially explicit estimates of annual spring migration phenology for 56 bird species across eastern North America. We show that changes in the spring arrival of migratory birds are coarsely synchronized with fluctuations in vegetation green-up and that the sensitivity of birds to plant phenology varied extensively. Bird arrival responded more synchronously with vegetation green-up at higher latitudes, where phenological shifts over time are also greater. Critically, species' migratory traits explained variation in sensitivity to green-up, with species that migrate more slowly, arrive earlier and overwinter further north showing greater responsiveness to earlier springs. Identifying how and why species vary in their ability to shift phenological events is fundamental to predicting species' vulnerability to climate change. Such variation in sensitivity across taxa, with long-distance neotropical migrants exhibiting reduced synchrony, may help to explain substantial declines in these species over the last several decades.},

  abstract = {Migratory birds regularly perform impressive long-distance flights, which are timed relative to the anticipated environmental resources at destination areas that can be several thousand kilometres away. Timely migration requires diverse strategies and adaptations that involve an intricate interplay between internal clock mechanisms and environmental conditions across the annual cycle. Here we review what challenges birds face during long migrations to keep track of time as they exploit geographically distant resources that may vary in availability and predictability, and summarize the clock mechanisms that enable them to succeed. We examine the following challenges: departing in time for spring and autumn migration, in anticipation of future environmental conditions; using clocks on the move, for example for orientation, navigation and stopover; strategies of adhering to, or adjusting, the time programme while fitting their activities into an annual cycle; and keeping pace with a world of rapidly changing environments. We then elaborate these themes by case studies representing long-distance migrating birds with different annual movement patterns and associated adaptations of their circannual programmes. We discuss the current knowledge on how endogenous migration programmes interact with external information across the annual cycle, how components of annual cycle programmes encode topography and range expansions, and how fitness may be affected when mismatches between timing and environmental conditions occur. Lastly, we outline open questions and propose future research directions. This article is part of the themed issue `Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals'.},

  abstract = {In migratory species, the temporal phases of the annual cycle are intrinsically linked to seasonally shifting geographic ranges. Despite intense interest in the annual cycle ecology of migration, a synthetic understanding of the relationship between the biogeography and phenology of seasonal migration remains elusive. Here, we interrogate the spatiotemporal structure of the annual cycle in a novel phylogenetic comparative framework. We use eBird, a massive avian occurrence dataset, to demarcate and measure in a consistent manner among species the portions of the annual cycle when a geographic distribution is stationary versus dynamic due to migration. Through comparative analyses of the durations of annual cycle stages for 150 species of migratory birds breeding in North America, we show that the duration of the migratory periods is remarkably consistent among species and is unrelated to the distance between breeding and nonbreeding locations. In other words, the seasonal distributions of long-distance migrants shift between their geographically distant stationary phases in the same amount of time as short-distance migrants, suggesting that individuals of long-distance migratory species have more synchronous periods of migration and likely a faster individual migratory pace than short-distance migrants. Our results further show that the amount of time a species spends on the breeding grounds is strongly inversely related to time spent on the nonbreeding grounds, revealing the length of the breeding versus nonbreeding stationary period to be the primary source of species-level variation in the pacing of the annual cycle, as opposed to the time needed for the migratory period. Further, our study reveals that the amount of time spent annually on the breeding versus nonbreeding grounds predicts the distance between breeding and nonbreeding locations, demonstrating key linkages between the biogeography of the migratory cycle, its phenology, and the evolution of life history tradeoffs.},

Here we test this hypothesis for lowland tropical birds by examining species' precipitation niche breadths. We focus on precipitation because it---not temperature---is the dominant climate variable that shapes the biota of the lowland tropics. We used 3.6 million fine-scale citizen science records from eBird to measure species' precipitation niche breadths in 19 different regions across the globe. Consistent with the predictions of the interspecific competition hypothesis, multiple lines of evidence show that species have narrower precipitation niches in regions with more species. This means species inhabit more specialized precipitation niches in species-rich regions. We predict this niche specialization should make tropical species in high diversity regions disproportionately vulnerable to changes in precipitation regimes; preliminary empirical evidence is consistent with this prediction.},

Here, we present a flyway-scale assessment of the spatial structure and seasonal dynamics of the Afro-Palaearctic bird migration system and explore how phenology of the environment guides long-distance migration. Location Europe and Africa. Time period 2009--2017. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods We compiled an individual-based dataset comprising 23 passerine and near-passerine species of 55 European breeding populations, in which a total of 564 individuals were tracked during migration between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we used remotely sensed primary productivity data (the normalized difference vegetation index) to estimate the timing of vegetation green-up in spring and senescence in autumn across Europe. First, we described how individual breeding and non-breeding sites and the migratory flyways link geographically. Second, we examined how the timing of migration along the two major Afro-Palaearctic flyways is tuned with vegetation phenology at the breeding sites. Results We found the longitudes of individual breeding and non-breeding sites to be related in a strongly positive manner, whereas the latitudes of breeding and non-breeding sites were related negatively. In autumn, migration commenced ahead of vegetation senescence, and the timing of migration was 5--7 days earlier along the Western flyway compared with the Eastern flyway. In spring, the time of arrival at breeding sites was c. 1.5 days later for each degree northwards and 6--7 days later along the Eastern compared with the Western flyway, reflecting the later spring green-up at higher latitudes and more eastern longitudes. Main conclusions Migration of the Afro-Palaearctic landbirds follows a longitudinally parallel leapfrog migration pattern, whereby migrants track vegetation green-up in spring but depart before vegetation senescence in autumn. The degree of continentality along migration routes and at the breeding sites of the birds influences the timing of migration on a broad scale.},

  abstract = {Over the past half century, migratory birds in North America have shown divergent population trends relative to resident species, with the former declining rapidly and the latter increasing. The role that climate change has played in these observed trends is not well understood, despite significant warming over this period. We used 43 y of monitoring data to fit dynamic species distribution models and quantify the rate of latitudinal range shifts in 32 species of birds native to eastern North America. Since the early 1970s, species that remain in North America throughout the year, including both resident and migratory species, appear to have responded to climate change through both colonization of suitable area at the northern leading edge of their breeding distributions and adaption in place at the southern trailing edges. Neotropical migrants, in contrast, have shown the opposite pattern: contraction at their southern trailing edges and no measurable shifts in their northern leading edges. As a result, the latitudinal distributions of temperate-wintering species have increased while the latitudinal distributions of neotropical migrants have decreased. These results raise important questions about the mechanisms that determine range boundaries of neotropical migrants and suggest that these species may be particularly vulnerable to future climate change. Our results highlight the potential importance of climate change during the nonbreeding season in constraining the response of migratory species to temperature changes at both the trailing and leading edges of their breeding distributions. Future research on the interactions between breeding and nonbreeding climate change is urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Summary. 1 In northern Europe, the northward movement of the sun in spring has so extensive an influence, that the food of all species of birds reaches its maximum at some time between late spring and early autumn. As a result, and in contrast to the tropics, nearly all species of birds lay their eggs in roughly the same period of the year. 2 A review of the breeding seasons of British birds reveals some interesting correlations between time of breeding and time of maximum food, and also many apparent puzzles, particularly as regards the marked differences in breeding season sometimes found between related species. 3 In Lapland, all species start breeding 1--2 months later than in Britain, and the breeding season is much less extended. As compared with Britain, the Corvidae and predatory birds of Lapland lay early relative to the small passerines, but among the small passerines, and also among the predators, the different species tend to breed in the same order relative to each other as they do in Britain. 4 Quantitative measurement of breeding seasons is much needed, and some examples showing the advantages of this method are given in Tables 1--3 and text-Figs. 1--5. 5 It is considered that, through the action of natural selection, the breeding season of each species coincides with the time of year when offspring can be raised with greatest success. The major ultimate factor involved is, therefore, the food for the young birds (and hence the factors which determine the abundance and availability of this food). But there may be modifying ultimate factors concerned with the survival of the parents, of the nest and eggs, and of the juvenile birds in the period soon after they leave the nest. 6 Proximate factors provide a physiological timing mechanism whereby the gonads recrudesce, and eggs are laid, at such a time that, on the average, the young hatch at a season when there is sufficient food to raise them. In European birds, daylength seems the major proximate factor, but there are several modifying factors, perhaps including temperature.},

  abstract = {Although a considerable amount of evidence suggesting endogenous annual clocks in plants and animals was accumulated during the first half of this century, their existence was not demonstrated before the early 1960's. The most compelling evidence then was provided by the work of Pengelley and Fisher (1957, 1963) with golden-mantled ground spuirrels (Spermophilus lateralis). Figure 2.1 shows the seasonal changes in body weight and food consumption, as well as the occurrence of hibernation, in two ground squirrels maintained for about 2 years under a constant LD 12:12 and constant temperature conditions. Both animals continued to hibernate about once a year, and each period of hibernation was preceded by a dramatic increase in body weight and food consumption. The general pattern of these seasonal functions was rather similar to that in free-living squirrels with an obvious difference that can be seen particularly clearly in the squirrel maintained in 0 {$^\circ$}C. In the first year of the experiment this animal entered hibernation in late October, but in the second the onset of hibernation had shifted forward to mid-August and in the third to early April. In other words, the period measured between onsets of hibernation was shorter than 12 months.},

  abstract = {Endogenous circannual clocks are found in many long-lived organisms, but are best studied in mammal and bird species. Circannual clocks are synchronized with the environment by changes in photoperiod, light intensity and possibly temperature and seasonal rainfall patterns. Annual timing mechanisms are presumed to have important ultimate functions in seasonally regulating reproduction, moult, hibernation, migration, body weight and fat deposition/stores. Birds that live in habitats where environmental cues such as photoperiod are poor predictors of seasons (e.g. equatorial residents, migrants to equatorial/tropical latitudes) rely more on their endogenous clocks than birds living in environments that show a tight correlation between photoperiod and seasonal events. Such population-specific/interspecific variation in reliance on endogenous clocks may indicate that annual timing mechanisms are adaptive. However, despite the apparent adaptive importance of circannual clocks, (i) what specific adaptive value they have in the wild and (ii) how they function are still largely untested. Whereas circadian clocks are hypothesized to be generated by molecular feedback loops, it has been suggested that circannual clocks are either based upon (i) a de-multiplication (`counting') of circadian days, (ii) a sequence of interdependent physiological states, or (iii) one or more endogenous oscillators, similar to circadian rhythms. We tested the de-multiplication of days (i) versus endogenous regulation hypotheses (ii) and (iii) in captive male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed the period of reproductive (testicular and follicular) cycles in four groups of birds kept either under photoperiods of LD 12{$\mkern1mu$}L{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}12{$\mkern1mu$}D (period length: 24{$\mkern1mu$}h), 13.5{$\mkern1mu$}L{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}13.5{$\mkern1mu$}D (27{$\mkern1mu$}h), 10.5{$\mkern1mu$}L{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}10.5{$\mkern1mu$}D (23{$\mkern1mu$}h) or 12{$\mkern1mu$}D{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}8{$\mkern1mu$}L{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}3{$\mkern1mu$}D{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}1{$\mkern1mu$}L (24-h skeleton photoperiod), respectively, for 15 months. Contrary to predictions from the de-multiplication hypothesis, individuals experiencing 27-h days did not differ (i.e. did not have longer) annual reproductive rhythms than individuals from the 21- or 24-h day groups. However, in line with predictions from endogenous regulation, birds in the skeleton group had significantly longer circannual period lengths than all other groups. Birds exposed to skeleton photoperiods experienced fewer light hours per year than all other groups (3285 versus 4380) and had a lower daily energy expenditure, as tested during one point of the annual cycle using respirometry. Although our results are tantalizing, they are still preliminary as birds were only studied over a period of 15 months. Nevertheless, the present data fail to support a `counting of circadian days' and instead support hypotheses proposing whole-organism processes as the mechanistic basis for circannual rhythms. We propose a novel energy turnover hypothesis which predicts a dependence of the speed of the circannual clock on the overall energy expenditure of an organism.},

  abstract = {Faster migration in spring than in autumn seems to be a common pattern in birds. This has been ultimately explained by seasonally different selection pressures. Variation in migration speed is proximately caused by adjusting travel speed (distance covered during flight) and/or stopover duration (times when birds rest and refuel). Yet, it remains unclear whether individual seasonal differences in migration speed match the common pattern and what the precise role of the proximate, behavioural mechanisms for adjusting migration speed is. By reviewing 64 studies of 401 tracks, I show that in waders, gulls, swifts, and songbirds speeds were significantly higher in spring, while the opposite was the case in waterfowl and owls. Thus, the ultimate mechanisms selecting for a faster migration in spring might not consistently act across bird groups. Breeding latitude, migration strategy, migration distance, flight style, body mass, and sex did not explain seasonal differences in speed. The ratio between spring and autumn total stopover duration of 257 bird tracks significantly negatively affected the seasonal migration speed ratio of the same individuals in a comparative analysis accounting for shared ancestry. Seasonal variation in stopover duration appears thus to be the main biological mechanism regulating seasonal differences in migration speed.},

Investigating spring and autumn migration performances is important for understanding ecological and evolutionary constraints in the timing and speed of migration. We compiled measurements from tracking studies and found a consistent predominance of cases showing higher speeds and shorter durations during spring compared to autumn, in terms of flight speeds (airspeed, ground speed, daily travel speed), stopover duration, and total speed and duration of migration. Seasonal differences in flight speeds were generally smaller than those in stopover durations and total speed/duration of migration, indicating that rates of foraging and fuel deposition were more important than flight speed in accounting for differences in overall migration performance. Still, the seasonal differences in flight speeds provide important support for time selection in spring migration.},

  abstract = {Migration is a common strategy used by birds that breed in seasonal environments. Selection for greater migration efficiency is likely to be stronger for terrestrial species whose migration strategies require non-stop transoceanic crossings. If multiple species use the same transoceanic flyway, then we expect the migration strategies of these species to converge geographically towards the most optimal solution. We test this by examining population-level migration trajectories within the Western Hemisphere for 118 migratory species using occurrence information from eBird. Geographical convergence of migration strategies was evident within specific terrestrial regions where geomorphological features such as mountains or isthmuses constrained overland migration. Convergence was also evident for transoceanic migrants that crossed the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean. Here, annual population-level movements were characterized by clockwise looped trajectories, which resulted in faster but more circuitous journeys in the spring and more direct journeys in the autumn. These findings suggest that the unique constraints and requirements associated with transoceanic migration have promoted the spatial convergence of migration strategies. The combination of seasonal atmospheric and environmental conditions that has facilitated the use of similar broad-scale migration strategies may be especially prone to disruption under climate and land-use change.},
