# Introduction

- Latitudinal migration is a widespread phenomenon across animal taxa. There is a wide range of migration strategies employed by species, particularly regarding when and how they migrate.
- Extent (range, distance) and fine-scale timing of latitudinal migration are well studied, but mostly put in context of vegetation phenology in breeding range [@briedis2020] or environmental conditions in wintering range [@saino2004; @gordo2005] or physiology [e.g., Gomez et al 2016, Zurell et al. 2018]. There has also been particular attention on how extent and timing of migration might be affected by climate change [@rushing2020].
- Species migrating to equatorial/tropical latitudes, where environmental cues such as photoperiod are poor predictors of seasons, tend to rely more on their internal circannual clocks [@akesson2017; @wikelski2007; @liedvogel2011]. This aspect of migratory restlessness driven by species-specific internal clocks has been referred to as *Zugunruhe* [@gwinner1967; @gwinner1986].
- However, a basic aspect of migration timing that has remained understudied is migration synchronicity. How quickly or slowly do species complete the occupation or evacuation (arrival or departure) of their wintering ranges? What determines which of these strategies a species employs? Why do some species spend longer occupying or vacating their nonbreeding range, while their close relatives spend much shorter times for these?
- There is a great diversity in species-specific strategies employed in this regard, with some species seeming to arrive across their broad wintering range all at once and some others occupying their southern limits months after the northern limits. 
- We know that such relationships between wintering latitude and migration timing are important (and more so than breeding latitude) [@hagan1991; @schmaljohann2018].
- Migration synchronicity is thus an emergent species-level property that has implications for all geographies occupied by the species. e.g., for certain species, India hosts their entire global population in winter (Blyth's Reed Warbler, Greenish Warbler)---global ecological (and conservation) significance. 
- Yet, much of this understanding of synchronicity remains anecodtal, unquantified, and without ecological context, particularly in countries like India. Such a macroecological understanding is difficult to obtain from studies of individual movement patterns, such as tracking studies.
- India occupies a large area and forms the wintering range for a large number of bird species (cite SoIB maps?) (also multiple flyways). In addition, the unique biogeography of the peninsula (funnelling/tapering down to lower latitudes before ending with the ocean) offers a unique opportunity to test such macroecological hypotheses regarding the link between migration synchronicity and wintering latitudes. *(This part can be supported by a figure: map of India for two wintering months, latitudes binned and coloured based on density of no. of wintering/all species.)*

## What we know

At the finer scale of individual migrating birds, migration speed is closely linked to flight speed and/or stopover duration (rest, fuel) [@schmaljohann2018]. Translated to macroecological context, migration synchronicity can be associated with intrinsic species-specific factors as well as external factors like environmental and landscape features. The major internal factors possibly affecting synchronicity are species' morphological traits (affecting flight speed capability, such as dispersal ability, body size?), migration distance [@winger2024], and urgency of migration (related to within- and across-season differences in programming of internal clocks). On the other hand, external factors refer to the biogeomorphology of migration routes and wintering ranges, which influences food availability, interspecific competition, etc. and therefore influences how conducive various latitudes are to the fitness of the birds.

There is evidence that the latter is more important [@schmaljohann2018; @nilsson2013; @lindstrom2003], even at the macroecological scale [@lasorte2016]. That is, external factors influencing aspects of foraging/fuelling are more important than intrinsic morphological or programmed factors like *Zugunruhe*. In India, this might be especially true for species taking the northwest vs Himalayan migration routes. In terms of both food availability and competition, the arid northwest region of India might be very conducive during the post-monsoon period (coinciding with arrival of winter migrants), due to the sudden burst in food availability coupled with lower competitive pressure due to lower local species richness. Thus, many species taking this route may spend longer coming down to reach the southern limit of their wintering range.

We test these multiple theories using our dataset, with the following predictions (simple illustrative graphs can be created later):

1. If synchronicity is linked to species morphology, synchronicity increases with increasing flight capability (dispersal ability/HWI, body mass, ?)
1. If synchronicity is determined by migration distance (geographical separation of breeding and non-breeding ranges), it:
    1. increases with greater wintering latitudinal breadth (or with more southern minimum wintering latitude) *[this is an extension of below]*
    1. increases with greater migration distance [@hagan1991; @winger2024] *[not sure if we want to test this]*
1. If synchronicity is driven by urgency of migration, it:
    1. increases with later migration start day [@hagan1991; @lack1950]
    1. is greater during departures (spring migration) than in arrivals (autumn migration) [@winger2024; @schmaljohann2018; @nilsson2013]
        <!-- - True for waders, gulls, swifts, and songbirds but opposite for waterfowl and owls [@schmaljohann2018] -->
1. If synchronicity is related to biogeomorphological factors, synchronicity of arrivals (autumn migration) is lesser for species using the northwest route of entry and greater for those crossing the Himalaya, whereas synchronicity of departures (spring migration) is not notably different between the two.
1. Null?

<!-- Other questions to answer briefly in results:

1. Does winter arrival/departure timing depend on the speciesâ€™s wintering latitude?
1. What is the most and least synchronicity and by which species?
1. Do species follow same synchronicity strategy for arrival and departure? (Symmetricity, see @winger2024) -->

## Metrics

- Migration timing:
    - True arrival/departure dates, not absolute (stragglers)
    - Synchronicity
- Wintering latitude:
    - Minimum
    - Extent/breadth/range
    - Median (probably not useful, other two capture enough info)

## Investigating arrival and departure timings & synchronicity

After all our selection and filtering criteria for wintering species of interest (giving `r n_distinct(win_spec_info$COMMON.NAME)` species), and after filtering data for each species to its wintering latitudinal range (removing latitudes where not purely wintering), we now start the analysis.

Using quantiles (assuming 95%), we determine "true" arrival and departure dates for each species per latitude. For a preliminary visualisation of patterns across species, we visualise this latitudinal trend of arrival (blue) & departure (red) times for all species:

```{r, fig.cap="True arrival and departure timings of our wintering species, using the quantile method.", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data1 <- data_full %>% 
  mutate(DAY.MY = if_else(DAY.Y > 147, DAY.Y-147, max(DAY.Y) - (147-DAY.Y))) |> 
  group_by(COMMON.NAME, LAT.BOX) %>% 
  distinct(GROUP.ID, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(N = n(),
            ARR = unname(quantile(DAY.MY, probs = 0.025, type = 1)), 
            DEP = unname(quantile(DAY.MY, probs = 0.975, type = 1))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = ARR:DEP,
               names_to = "DATE.TYPE", values_to = "DAY.MY") %>% 
  mutate(DATE.TYPE = factor(DATE.TYPE, levels = c("DEP","ARR"))) |> 
  # join week info
  left_join(data_full |> 
              mutate(DAY.MY = if_else(DAY.Y > 147, DAY.Y-147, max(DAY.Y) - (147-DAY.Y))) |> 
              distinct(DAY.MY, WEEK.MY),
            by = "DAY.MY")


illust_species <- c("Blyth's Reed Warbler", "Lesser Whitethroat", "Sykes's Warbler",
                    "Greenish Warbler", "Green Warbler", "Common Chiffchaff",
                    "Brown-breasted Flycatcher", "Black Redstart", "Brown-headed Gull", 
                    "Brown Shrike", "Bar-headed Goose", "Booted Eagle", "Common Buzzard", 
                    "Eurasian Wigeon", "Tufted Duck", "Bar-tailed Godwit", 
                    "Greater Spotted Eagle", "Cinereous Vulture", "Gray Wagtail", 
                    "Pallid Harrier", "Siberian Stonechat", "Spotted Redshank", 
                    "Western Yellow Wagtail", "Taiga Flycatcher", "Red-breasted Flycatcher")


plot_arr <- data1 %>% gg_lat_day("ARR", FALSE, sync = FALSE)
plot_dep <- data1 %>% gg_lat_day("DEP", FALSE, sync = FALSE)

# plot_arrdep <- plot_arr / plot_dep +
#   plot_annotation(
#     title = "Variation of first arrival and last departure dates with latitude",
#     subtitle = "Using quantiles of weekly records per latitude to assign arrival and departure"
#     )

ggsave("02_explor_figs/01_arr.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 20, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/01_dep.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 20, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/01_arr.png")
knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/01_dep.png")

```

We now calculate metrics for migration timings, such as first northern/southern arrival & departure, and synchronicity which is our primary metric of interest. We describe synchronicity using two (presumably) orthogonal angles: slope (quickness of migration) and tightness (uniformity) across latitudes. (Correlation R^2^ cannot be used for the measure of tightness, since for high slope values, R^2^ becomes low.)

Here are the synchronicity measures (`SYNC.SLOPE` & `SYNC.TIGHT`) for a set of illustrative species, followed by updated plots for the same species.

```{r, fig.cap="Set of illustrative species arranged in order of synchronicity of arrival/departure.", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mig_spec_info <- data1 %>% 
  group_by(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE) %>% 
  arrange(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE, desc(LAT.BOX)) %>% 
  # first northern/southern arrival & departure dates
  mutate(NORTH.DAY = first(DAY.MY),
         NORTH.WEEK = first(WEEK.MY),
         SOUTH.DAY = last(DAY.MY),
         SOUTH.WEEK = last(WEEK.MY)) %>% 
  # measures of synchronicity
  calc_sync_meas() 

mig_spec_info %>% 
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.SLOPE, SYNC.TIGHT) %>% 
  print(n = 100)


# join migration metrics back to data and plot same first graphs
data2 <- data1 %>% 
  left_join(mig_spec_info, by = c("COMMON.NAME", "DATE.TYPE")) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.SLOPE, SYNC.TIGHT)


plot_arr <- data2 %>% gg_lat_day("ARR", TRUE, sync = TRUE)
plot_dep <- data2 %>% gg_lat_day("DEP", TRUE, sync = TRUE)

ggsave("02_explor_figs/02_arr_sync.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/02_dep_sync.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/02_arr_sync.png")
knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/02_dep_sync.png")

```

All our species can be visualised as occupying a 2-D space governed by the two measures of synchronicity. Based on their occupancy of this space, we can classify their overall synchronicity. 

```{r sync-space, fig.cap="2D space of synchronicity measures of our species.", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

plot_syncspace <- mig_spec_info %>% 
  # silencing labels of species except our illustrative ones
  mutate(LABEL = case_when(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species ~ COMMON.NAME,
                           TRUE ~ "")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(SYNC.SLOPE, SYNC.TIGHT, group = COMMON.NAME, colour = DATE.TYPE)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = LABEL), size = 3, position = "jitter") +
  facet_wrap(~ DATE.TYPE, ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#b22222", "#006994")) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey90"),
        legend.position = "none")

ggsave("02_explor_figs/02_sync_space.png", plot = plot_syncspace,
       width = 10, height = 20, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/02_sync_space.png")

```

Now will try to combine the two variables into a single index of synchronicity. Relative weights are obtained from PCA of the two variables, and the index (`SYNC.IND`) is a linear combination of the two. New values and updated graphs below.

```{r, fig.cap="Species arranged in order of combination of two synchronicity measures.", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}


sync_props <- get_pca_prop(mig_spec_info)

# mig_spec_info %>% 
#   # silencing labels of species except our illustrative ones
#   mutate(LABEL = case_when(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species ~ COMMON.NAME,
#                            TRUE ~ ""),
#          SYNC.TOT = 0.6*SYNC.SLOPE + 0.4*SYNC.TIGHT) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(SYNC.TOT, SYNC.TIGHT, group = COMMON.NAME, colour = DATE.TYPE)) +
#   geom_point() +
#   geom_text(aes(label = LABEL), size = 3, position = "jitter") +
#   facet_wrap(~ DATE.TYPE, ncol = 1) +
#   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, 1)) +
#   scale_color_manual(values = c("#b22222", "#006994")) +
#   theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey90"),
#         legend.position = "none")

# calculate new sync index with relative weights
mig_spec_info <- mig_spec_info %>% 
  mutate(SYNC.IND = sync_props[1]*SYNC.SLOPE + sync_props[2]*SYNC.TIGHT)

mig_spec_info %>% 
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.IND) %>% 
  dplyr::select(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE, starts_with("SYNC.")) %>% 
  print(n = 100)


# join migration metrics back to data and plot same first graphs
data3 <- data1 %>% 
  left_join(mig_spec_info, by = c("COMMON.NAME", "DATE.TYPE")) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.IND) 


plot_arr <- data3 %>% gg_lat_day("ARR", TRUE, sync = TRUE)
plot_dep <- data3 %>% gg_lat_day("DEP", TRUE, sync = TRUE)

ggsave("02_explor_figs/03_arr_sync_index.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/03_dep_sync_index.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/03_arr_sync_index.png")
knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/03_dep_sync_index.png")

```

Clearly, there is still some finetuning to be done with the "quickness" metric, i.e., derived from slope. For the most synchronous species with little difference between them, the values are drastically different. Also need to figure out how to appropriately weight the two so that high togetherness is prioritised.

Further try ordinations to understand what factors (wintering, migrating) determine synchronicity of species.

## Finalise synchronicity

On discussing with AV, we realised that the second aspect, "tightness" is better viewed as noise rather than information. Even if it appears to have ecological meaning, this is only true for high tightness values and here the information is mostly just from the first metric. So, instead of trying to combine the two aspects, better to ignore species with tightness lower than some threshold value. Consider that low tightness can either be just noise in data, or lack of a strong north-south migration signal in the species, and we can't tease apart the two (and not of interest in this study; though might still be an orthogonal aspect of synchronicity). 
So, changes applied:

- Set threshold for variability (tightness) along slope, exclude species above this from our main regression tests with latitude
- With all species (including those excluded above), we divide synchronicity into N bins (think X axis of Fig. \@ref(fig:sync-space)) and within each bin show how variability (signal) can range from low to high. e.g., highly staggered species can range from BRW (very strong migration signal) to CiVu (less strong signal); very synchronous species can range from BHGo to SpRedshank.
- So now our measure of synchronicity is much simplified: there is only one metric, and that too can be simply the slope from the LM (*without* any transformations). 
    - LM seems the best bet here; I did try GLM Poisson but the slope there is not the information we want
    - Also, LM estimates with and without scaling the DAY.MY to start from 0 (for each species and arrival/departure combo) were the same, so leave it unscaled. *See below.*
    
```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data1 %>% 
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% c(
    "Black-throated Thrush", "Eurasian Griffon", "Common Pochard", "Black-naped Oriole", 
    "Black-capped Kingfisher"
  ), DATE.TYPE == "ARR") %>% 
  mutate(DAY.MIG = DAY.MY - min(DAY.MY)) %>% 
  group_by(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE) %>% 
  reframe(LM.SLOPE = summary(lm(DAY.MY ~ LAT.BOX, data = cur_group()))$coef[2, 1],
          LM.SE = summary(lm(DAY.MY ~ LAT.BOX, data = cur_group()))$coef[2, 2],
          SCALED.LM.SLOPE = summary(lm(DAY.MIG ~ LAT.BOX, data = cur_group()))$coef[2, 1],
          SCALED.LM.SE = summary(lm(DAY.MIG ~ LAT.BOX, data = cur_group()))$coef[2, 2],
          GLM.SLOPE = summary(glm(DAY.MIG ~ LAT.BOX, 
                                  data = cur_group(), family = poisson))$coef[2, 1] %>% exp(),
          GLM.SE = summary(glm(DAY.MIG ~ LAT.BOX, 
                               data = cur_group(), family = poisson))$coef[2, 2] %>% exp())
```

Arranging in order of new synchronicity index (slope of LM):

```{r, fig.cap="Species arranged in order of synchronicity (slope).", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# calculate new sync index 
mig_spec_info <- mig_spec_info %>% 
  dplyr::select(-starts_with("SYNC.")) %>% 
  rename(SYNC.IND = SLOPE)

mig_spec_info %>% 
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.IND) %>% 
  print(n = 100)


# join migration metrics back to data and plot same first graphs
data4 <- data1 %>% 
  left_join(mig_spec_info, by = c("COMMON.NAME", "DATE.TYPE")) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.IND) 


plot_arr <- data4 %>% gg_lat_day_sync("ARR", TRUE)
plot_dep <- data4 %>% gg_lat_day_sync("DEP", TRUE)

ggsave("02_explor_figs/04_arr_sync_slope.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/04_dep_sync_slope.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/04_dep_sync_slope.png")

```

### Determining threshold cutoff for variability (tightness)

This is not very straightforward. Here is a summary of some select species and various measures of theirs (R-squared, residual standard error, degrees of freedom, F statistic, root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of variation).

          CV = (sd(summary(lm(DAY.MY ~ LAT.BOX, data = cur_group()))$residuals))/

RMSE, MAE, and RSE make the most sense. Using thresholds of 20, 20, and 25 respectively, here is a summary of our example species that passed or failed wrt ARRIVAL timings.

```{r, arr-criteria, fig.cap="Comparisons of different measures of variability for arrival timings.", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

testing_arr <- testing_criteria %>% 
  filter(DATE.TYPE == "ARR") %>% 
  keep_remove_label(arr_remove, arr_maybe_remove, arr_keep) %>% 
  mutate(RMSE.PASS = ifelse(RMSE > 20, FALSE, TRUE),
         MAE.PASS = ifelse(MAE > 20, FALSE, TRUE),
         RSE.PASS = ifelse(RSE > 25, FALSE, TRUE))

testing_arr %>% 
  dplyr::select(COMMON.NAME, SLOPE, SE, RSE, RMSE, MAE, RSE.PASS, RMSE.PASS, MAE.PASS) %>% 
  # filter(COMMON.NAME %in% "Common Pochard")
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  print(n = 100)

compare_arr <- ((testing_arr %>% species_to_label(RSE.PASS) %>% gg_criteria(RSE.PASS, RSE, 25)) |
  (testing_arr %>% species_to_label(RMSE.PASS) %>% gg_criteria(RMSE.PASS, RMSE, 20)) |
  (testing_arr %>% species_to_label(MAE.PASS) %>% gg_criteria(MAE.PASS, MAE, 20))) +
  plot_layout(nrow = 1, guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(title = "Comparisons of different measures of variability for ARRIVAL timings")

ggsave("02_explor_figs/05_compare_var_arr.png", plot = compare_arr,
       width = 20, height = 10, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/05_compare_var_arr.png")

```

It is evident that RMSE is the most susceptible to single, large-deviance points pulling away the overall measure. It also seems that MAE might be the most appropriate for us: aside from Dunlin and Pied Harrier (which are treated similarly by all three), all other `remove` species have been clustered tightly and separated from the species we want to retain.

Let us check whether this is true for departure timings as well. Here, the best thresholds are 14, 10 and 15 respectively for RMSE, MAE and RSE.

```{r, dep-criteria, fig.cap="Comparisons of different measures of variability for departure timings.", cache=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

testing_dep <- testing_criteria %>% 
  filter(DATE.TYPE == "DEP") %>% 
  keep_remove_label(dep_remove, dep_maybe_remove, dep_keep) %>% 
  mutate(RMSE.PASS = ifelse(RMSE > 14, FALSE, TRUE),
         MAE.PASS = ifelse(MAE > 10, FALSE, TRUE),
         RSE.PASS = ifelse(RSE > 15, FALSE, TRUE))

testing_dep %>% 
  dplyr::select(COMMON.NAME, SLOPE, SE, RSE, RMSE, MAE, RSE.PASS, RMSE.PASS, MAE.PASS) %>% 
  # filter(COMMON.NAME %in% "Common Pochard")
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  print(n = 100)

compare_dep <- ((testing_dep %>% species_to_label(RSE.PASS) %>% gg_criteria(RSE.PASS, RSE, 15)) |
  (testing_dep %>% species_to_label(RMSE.PASS) %>% gg_criteria(RMSE.PASS, RMSE, 14)) |
  (testing_dep %>% species_to_label(MAE.PASS) %>% gg_criteria(MAE.PASS, MAE, 10))) +
  plot_layout(nrow = 1, guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(title = "Comparisons of different measures of variability for DEPARTURE timings")

ggsave("02_explor_figs/05_compare_var_dep.png", plot = compare_dep,
       width = 20, height = 10, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/05_compare_var_dep.png")

```

RMSE seems like a poor option again. MAE is again decent, but this time RSE is also good. Need to see how values for species change with updated 2024 data.

The number of species that pass and fail each criterion are:

```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

testing_arr %>% 
  bind_rows(testing_dep) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(ends_with(".PASS")), 
               names_to = "CRITERION", values_to = "PASS") %>% 
  group_by(DATE.TYPE, CRITERION, PASS) %>% 
  reframe(NO.SP = n_distinct(COMMON.NAME)) %>% 
  mutate(PASS = ifelse(PASS == TRUE, "PASS", "FAIL")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "PASS", values_from = "NO.SP") %>% 
  mutate(PASS.PROP = PASS/(FAIL + PASS))

```
