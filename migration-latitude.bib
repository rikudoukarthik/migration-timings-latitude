  abstract = {Under laboratory conditions, two mechanisms have been identified that control the onset of migration. One mechanism inflexibly controls the initiation of migration, while the other requires external input from a changing environment. It has been suggested that the evolution of these mechanisms has an ecological basis related to the wintering latitude of the species. To establish whether the timing of migration was consistent with this ecological explanation, we studied the long-term mean timing of spring migration, and within-year and among-year variance in timing, in 27 free-living Nearctic migrant species. Species that wintered in higher, temperate latitudes migrated significantly earlier than tropical-wintering species. Tropical-wintering species showed significantly less within-year and among-year variation in the timing of migration, suggesting that the mechanism regulating their migration is primarily endogenous, with little influence of external stimuli. In contrast, breeding latitude showed no relationship to the mean date of migration, or the within-year or among-year variation in timing. These results are consistent with the notion that conditions that indicate time-of-year are unreliable or change imperceptibly (photoperiod) in the tropics, making an endogenous circannual clock valuable for controlling the onset and progression of migration. Temperate-wintering species were more likely to show interspecific correlations in timing than tropical species, further suggesting that external cues modulate spring migration in temperate-wintering species. Our results indicate that the migration regulation system employed might be ultimately determined by wintering latitude and associated environmental cues.},

  abstract = {We attempt to quantify the relationship between migration and latitude in the avifauna of eastern North America. Progressing northward up the east side of the continent, the proportion of breeding species that moves south for the winter increases steadily, from 12\% at 25{$^\circ$}N (southern Florida) to 87\% at 80{$^\circ$}N (Ellesmere Island), a mean increase of 1.4\% for every degree of latitude. Conversely, the proportion of wintering species that moves north for the summer decreases with latitude, from 52\% at 25{$^\circ$}N to none at 70{$^\circ$}N, a mean decrease of 1.1\% for every degree of latitude. These relationships hold despite the fact that 24\% of all species breeding in eastern North America leave the area completely in fall to winter south of 25{$^\circ$}N, mostly in Central and South America (including the Caribbean Islands). These trends are similar to those in western Europe, but at any given latitude an average of 17\% more breeding species leave for the winter in eastern North America, and 10\% more wintering species leave for the summer. This difference is attributed to climate, in that at any given latitude temperatures are cooler in eastern North America than in Europe. We argue that relationships between migration and latitude exist because latitude is a good surrogate measure of factors likely to more directly influence migration, such as climate and daylength, which in turn control the amplitude of seasonal changes in food supplies.},

The results suggest that seasonal changes in available food resources may be effectively less in deciduous forest than in coniferous forest (in contrast to MacArthur's conclusion).

  abstract = {There is a conspicuous gradient in the proportion of passerine breeding communities contributed by tropical migrants (PPM) in Europe, with communities located in the northernmost areas showing the greatest percentages and those located to the south the smallest. I used multiple stepwise regression and regression on principal components to investigate the effects of a set of ecological, climatic, and geographical variables on migrant percentages in a sample of 55 European censuses distributed from northern Fennoscandia through southern Spain. When the main habitat types are considered individually, this geographic pattern is still significant. The best single predictor of PPM as revealed by multiple regression analyses is latitude, but when this variable is removed, the temperature of the coldest month provides almost equivalent predictions of PPM. Habitat type per se apparently does not influence substantially the percent of migrants in European breeding passerine communities. These results contrast with those reported by MacArthur (1959) for North America, although they are consistent with some suggestions derived from the recent reanalysis of North American data carried out by Willson (1976). Intercontinental differences are perhaps due to sampling deficiencies in the North American areas studied, mainly derived from the restricted latitudinal range. To explain the European pattern of PPM, I suggest that the percentage of migrants in a community during the breeding season depends on both the harshness of adverse winter conditions faced by the resident populations and on the total resource availability during the breeding period. Carrying capacity of the habitat during the severe season will to some extent regulate the size of resident populations in the following breeding period, which in turn must affect the abundance of migrants that may successfully colonize the habitat. Very harsh winters coupled to very productive breeding seasons favor the largest percentage of migrants.},

  abstract = {The life cycles of plants and animals are changing around the world in line with the predictions originated from hypotheses concerning the impact of global warming and climate change on biological systems. Commonly, the search for ecological mechanisms behind the observed changes in bird phenology has focused on the analysis of climatic patterns from the species breeding grounds. However, the ecology of bird migration suggests that the spring arrival of long-distance migrants (such as trans-Saharan birds) is more likely to be influenced by climate conditions in wintering areas given their direct impact on the onset of migration and its progression. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the first arrival dates (FADs) of six trans-Saharan migrants (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, swift Apus apus, hoopoe Upupa epops, swallow Hirundo rustica, house martin Delichon urbica and nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos), in a western Mediterranean area since from 1952 to 2003. By means of multiple regression analyses, FADs were analysed in relation to the monthly temperature and precipitation patterns of five African climatic regions south of the Sahara where species are thought to overwinter and from the European site from where FADs were collected. We obtained significant models for five species explaining 9--41\% of the variation in FADs. The interpretation of the models suggests that: (1) The climate in wintering quarters, especially the precipitation, has a stronger influence on FADs than that in the species' potential European breeding grounds. (2) The accumulative effects of climate patterns prior to migration onset may be of considerable importance since those climate variables that served to summarize climate patterns 12 months prior to the onset of migration were selected by final models. (3) Temperature and precipitation in African regions are likely to affect departure decision in the species studied through their indirect effects on food availability and the build-up of reserves for migration. Our results concerning the factors that affect the arrival times of trans-Saharan migrants indicate that the effects of climate change are more complex than previously suggested, and that these effects might have an interacting impact on species ecology, for example by reversing ecological pressures during species' life cycles.},

Arrival date of old but not young individuals captured during consecutive breeding seasons was earlier after winters with favourable conditions. Change in arrival date in relation to change in NDVI was similar in the two sexes. Change in arrival date significantly and positively predicted change in breeding date. As a result of increased frequency of second broods determined by earlier arrival, the number of fledged offspring per season was larger after African winters with good in comparison to poor ecological conditions for barn swallows.

  abstract = {Animals and plants are shifting the timing of key life events in response to climate change, yet despite recent documentation of escalating phenological change, scientists lack a full understanding of how and why phenological responses vary across space and among species. Here, we used over 7\,million community-contributed bird observations to derive species-specific, spatially explicit estimates of annual spring migration phenology for 56 bird species across eastern North America. We show that changes in the spring arrival of migratory birds are coarsely synchronized with fluctuations in vegetation green-up and that the sensitivity of birds to plant phenology varied extensively. Bird arrival responded more synchronously with vegetation green-up at higher latitudes, where phenological shifts over time are also greater. Critically, species' migratory traits explained variation in sensitivity to green-up, with species that migrate more slowly, arrive earlier and overwinter further north showing greater responsiveness to earlier springs. Identifying how and why species vary in their ability to shift phenological events is fundamental to predicting species' vulnerability to climate change. Such variation in sensitivity across taxa, with long-distance neotropical migrants exhibiting reduced synchrony, may help to explain substantial declines in these species over the last several decades.},

  abstract = {Migratory birds regularly perform impressive long-distance flights, which are timed relative to the anticipated environmental resources at destination areas that can be several thousand kilometres away. Timely migration requires diverse strategies and adaptations that involve an intricate interplay between internal clock mechanisms and environmental conditions across the annual cycle. Here we review what challenges birds face during long migrations to keep track of time as they exploit geographically distant resources that may vary in availability and predictability, and summarize the clock mechanisms that enable them to succeed. We examine the following challenges: departing in time for spring and autumn migration, in anticipation of future environmental conditions; using clocks on the move, for example for orientation, navigation and stopover; strategies of adhering to, or adjusting, the time programme while fitting their activities into an annual cycle; and keeping pace with a world of rapidly changing environments. We then elaborate these themes by case studies representing long-distance migrating birds with different annual movement patterns and associated adaptations of their circannual programmes. We discuss the current knowledge on how endogenous migration programmes interact with external information across the annual cycle, how components of annual cycle programmes encode topography and range expansions, and how fitness may be affected when mismatches between timing and environmental conditions occur. Lastly, we outline open questions and propose future research directions. This article is part of the themed issue `Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals'.},

  abstract = {In migratory species, the temporal phases of the annual cycle are intrinsically linked to seasonally shifting geographic ranges. Despite intense interest in the annual cycle ecology of migration, a synthetic understanding of the relationship between the biogeography and phenology of seasonal migration remains elusive. Here, we interrogate the spatiotemporal structure of the annual cycle in a novel phylogenetic comparative framework. We use eBird, a massive avian occurrence dataset, to demarcate and measure in a consistent manner among species the portions of the annual cycle when a geographic distribution is stationary versus dynamic due to migration. Through comparative analyses of the durations of annual cycle stages for 150 species of migratory birds breeding in North America, we show that the duration of the migratory periods is remarkably consistent among species and is unrelated to the distance between breeding and nonbreeding locations. In other words, the seasonal distributions of long-distance migrants shift between their geographically distant stationary phases in the same amount of time as short-distance migrants, suggesting that individuals of long-distance migratory species have more synchronous periods of migration and likely a faster individual migratory pace than short-distance migrants. Our results further show that the amount of time a species spends on the breeding grounds is strongly inversely related to time spent on the nonbreeding grounds, revealing the length of the breeding versus nonbreeding stationary period to be the primary source of species-level variation in the pacing of the annual cycle, as opposed to the time needed for the migratory period. Further, our study reveals that the amount of time spent annually on the breeding versus nonbreeding grounds predicts the distance between breeding and nonbreeding locations, demonstrating key linkages between the biogeography of the migratory cycle, its phenology, and the evolution of life history tradeoffs.},
