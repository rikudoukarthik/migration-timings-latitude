# Introduction

- Relationship between migration timings and latitude has received some attention, such as: In breeding ranges, how does latitude influence the migrant proportion of bird populations? i.e. whether or not a breeding bird migrates south. 
- Studies on *when* migration occurs:
    - Either on effect of breeding latitudes
    - Various other env. variables affect migration timing, and how this changes with climate change [@saino2004, @gordo2005]
    - Or asking how wintering latitudes affect timing of arrival in breeding grounds
        - Species wintering in higher/temperate latitudes migrate (arrive in breeding range) earlier than tropical wintering ones. Breeding latitude does not have an effect. [@hagan1991]
- Synchronicity of migration itself has received very little attention
    - But from @hagan1991 we can retain the notion of synchronicity. According to those findings, the greater the latitudinal range occupied by a species in winter, the more asynchronous its migration will be. 
    - The reality, and what we can see in our prelim explorations, is a bit more complex than that, of course. Not a linear relationship.
    - But what exactly is the relationship between migration timings (special focus on synchronicity) and wintering latitudes (minima, median, breadth)? And what does the relationship imply ecologically?
    - Also related to Zugunruhe, as suggested for *Phylloscopus* [@akesson2017]
    - Longer-distance migrants more synchronous [@winger2024]

Most migration studies heavily physiological, while our aim with this is more functional (traits-based). Macroecological perspective on seasonal flux of animal movement (different from tracking studies), allowing cross-species comparisons of broad-scale strategies in pace and geography of annual cycle stages. 

We also have certain species whose entire global population winters in India (e.g., Blyth's Reed Warbler, Greenish Warbler). This is a good opportunity to gain understandings of global ecological (and conservation) significance. 

## Questions

1. Cross-species comparisons:
    1. Does winter arrival/departure timing depend on the species’s wintering latitude?
    1. Does winter migration synchronicity depend on the species’s wintering latitude?
    1. Do species migrating later in season tend to migrate more synchronously?
    1. Is winter arrival/departure timing changing over the years (climate change)? 
        - *As a final section, if relevant and feasible (low data, quantile method might fail.).*
        - Or, instead can maybe try to correlate with temperature gradient across latitudes to speculate.
1. Within-species comparisons:
    1. Do species follow same synchronicity strategy for arrival and departure? (Symmetricity, see @winger2024)
        1. Which do, and which don't (what determines this)?
    1. Is synchronicity more likely/common in arrival than in departure or vice-versa?
        - Many species have narrower window in spring than in fall [@winger2024 for references]
        - In India (maybe unique) we have monsoon, so most species probably spend longer coming down due to availability of food in post-monsoon

Northwest vs Himalayan routes

**Metrics**:

- Migration timing:
    - True arrival/departure, not absolute (stragglers)
    - Synchronicity
- Wintering latitude:
    - Minimum
    - Median
    - Extent/breadth/range

## Investigating arrival and departure timings & synchronicity

After all our selection and filtering criteria for wintering species of interest (giving `r n_distinct(win_spec_info$COMMON.NAME)` species), and after filtering data for each species to its wintering latitudinal range (removing latitudes where not purely wintering), we now start the analysis.

Using quantiles (assuming 95%), we determine "true" arrival and departure dates for each species per latitude. For a preliminary visualisation of patterns across species, we visualise this latitudinal trend of arrival (blue) & departure (red) times for all species:

```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data1 <- data_full %>% 
  mutate(DAY.MY = if_else(DAY.Y > 147, DAY.Y-147, max(DAY.Y) - (147-DAY.Y))) |> 
  group_by(COMMON.NAME, LAT.BOX) %>% 
  distinct(GROUP.ID, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  summarise(N = n(),
            ARR = unname(quantile(DAY.MY, probs = 0.025, type = 1)), 
            DEP = unname(quantile(DAY.MY, probs = 0.975, type = 1))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = ARR:DEP,
               names_to = "DATE.TYPE", values_to = "DAY.MY") %>% 
  mutate(DATE.TYPE = factor(DATE.TYPE, levels = c("DEP","ARR"))) |> 
  # join week info
  left_join(data_full |> 
              mutate(DAY.MY = if_else(DAY.Y > 147, DAY.Y-147, max(DAY.Y) - (147-DAY.Y))) |> 
              distinct(DAY.MY, WEEK.MY),
            by = "DAY.MY")


illust_species <- c("Blyth's Reed Warbler", "Lesser Whitethroat", "Sykes's Warbler",
                    "Greenish Warbler", "Green Warbler", "Common Chiffchaff",
                    "Brown-breasted Flycatcher", "Black Redstart", "Brown-headed Gull", 
                    "Brown Shrike", "Bar-headed Goose", "Booted Eagle", "Common Buzzard", 
                    "Eurasian Wigeon", "Tufted Duck", "Bar-tailed Godwit", 
                    "Greater Spotted Eagle", "Cinereous Vulture", "Gray Wagtail", 
                    "Pallid Harrier", "Siberian Stonechat", "Spotted Redshank", 
                    "Western Yellow Wagtail", "Taiga Flycatcher", "Red-breasted Flycatcher")


plot_arr <- data1 %>% gg_lat_day("ARR", FALSE, sync = FALSE)
plot_dep <- data1 %>% gg_lat_day("DEP", FALSE, sync = FALSE)

# plot_arrdep <- plot_arr / plot_dep +
#   plot_annotation(
#     title = "Variation of first arrival and last departure dates with latitude",
#     subtitle = "Using quantiles of weekly records per latitude to assign arrival and departure"
#     )

ggsave("02_explor_figs/01_arr.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 20, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/01_dep.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 20, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/01_arr.png")
knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/01_dep.png")

```

We now calculate metrics for migration timings, such as first northern/southern arrival & departure, and synchronicity which is our primary metric of interest. We describe synchronicity using two (presumably) orthogonal angles: slope (quickness of migration) and tightness (uniformity) across latitudes. (Correlation R^2 cannot be used for the measure of tightness, since for high slope values, R2 becomes low.)

Here are the synchronicity measures (`SYNC.SLOPE` & `SYNC.TIGHT`) for a set of illustrative species, followed by updated plots for the same species.

```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mig_spec_info <- data1 %>% 
  group_by(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE) %>% 
  arrange(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE, desc(LAT.BOX)) %>% 
  # first northern/southern arrival & departure dates
  mutate(NORTH.DAY = first(DAY.MY),
         NORTH.WEEK = first(WEEK.MY),
         SOUTH.DAY = last(DAY.MY),
         SOUTH.WEEK = last(WEEK.MY)) %>% 
  # measures of synchronicity
  calc_sync_meas() 

mig_spec_info %>% 
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.SLOPE, SYNC.TIGHT) %>% 
  print(n = 100)


# join migration metrics back to data and plot same first graphs
data2 <- data1 %>% 
  left_join(mig_spec_info, by = c("COMMON.NAME", "DATE.TYPE")) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.SLOPE, SYNC.TIGHT)


plot_arr <- data2 %>% gg_lat_day("ARR", TRUE, sync = TRUE)
plot_dep <- data2 %>% gg_lat_day("DEP", TRUE, sync = TRUE)

ggsave("02_explor_figs/02_arr_sync.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/02_dep_sync.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/02_arr_sync.png")
knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/02_dep_sync.png")

```

All our species can be visualised as occupying a 2-D space governed by the two measures of synchronicity. Based on their occupancy of this space, we can classify their overall synchronicity. 

```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

plot_syncspace <- mig_spec_info %>% 
  # silencing labels of species except our illustrative ones
  mutate(LABEL = case_when(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species ~ COMMON.NAME,
                           TRUE ~ "")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(SYNC.SLOPE, SYNC.TIGHT, group = COMMON.NAME, colour = DATE.TYPE)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = LABEL), size = 3, position = "jitter") +
  facet_wrap(~ DATE.TYPE, ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#b22222", "#006994")) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey90"),
        legend.position = "none")

ggsave("02_explor_figs/02_sync_space.png", plot = plot_syncspace,
       width = 10, height = 20, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/02_sync_space.png")

```

Now will try to combine the two variables into a single index of synchronicity. Relative weights are obtained from PCA of the two variables, and the index (`SYNC.IND`) is a linear combination of the two. New values and updated graphs below.

```{r, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}


sync_props <- get_pca_prop(mig_spec_info)

# mig_spec_info %>% 
#   # silencing labels of species except our illustrative ones
#   mutate(LABEL = case_when(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species ~ COMMON.NAME,
#                            TRUE ~ ""),
#          SYNC.TOT = 0.6*SYNC.SLOPE + 0.4*SYNC.TIGHT) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(SYNC.TOT, SYNC.TIGHT, group = COMMON.NAME, colour = DATE.TYPE)) +
#   geom_point() +
#   geom_text(aes(label = LABEL), size = 3, position = "jitter") +
#   facet_wrap(~ DATE.TYPE, ncol = 1) +
#   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, 1)) +
#   scale_color_manual(values = c("#b22222", "#006994")) +
#   theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey90"),
#         legend.position = "none")

# calculate new sync index with relative weights
mig_spec_info <- mig_spec_info %>% 
  mutate(SYNC.IND = sync_props[1]*SYNC.SLOPE + sync_props[2]*SYNC.TIGHT)

mig_spec_info %>% 
  filter(COMMON.NAME %in% illust_species) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.IND) %>% 
  dplyr::select(COMMON.NAME, DATE.TYPE, starts_with("SYNC.")) %>% 
  print(n = 100)


# join migration metrics back to data and plot same first graphs
data3 <- data1 %>% 
  left_join(mig_spec_info, by = c("COMMON.NAME", "DATE.TYPE")) %>% 
  arrange(DATE.TYPE, SYNC.IND) 


plot_arr <- data3 %>% gg_lat_day("ARR", TRUE, sync = TRUE)
plot_dep <- data3 %>% gg_lat_day("DEP", TRUE, sync = TRUE)

ggsave("02_explor_figs/03_arr_sync_index.png", plot = plot_arr,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")
ggsave("02_explor_figs/03_dep_sync_index.png", plot = plot_dep,
       width = 15, height = 15, units = "in")

knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/03_arr_sync_index.png")
knitr::include_graphics("02_explor_figs/03_dep_sync_index.png")

```

Clearly, there is still some finetuning to be done with the "quickness" metric, i.e., derived from slope. For the most synchronous species with little difference between them, the values are drastically different. Also need to figure out how to appropriately weight the two so that high togetherness is prioritised.

Further try ordinations to understand what factors (wintering, migrating) determine synchronicity of species.
